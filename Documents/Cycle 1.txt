Cycle 1 Status Report
The team objectives were as follows:
1. Load the files from txt files.
2. Create entities and a player that responds to key presses to move about the map.
3. Track the amount of emeralds the hero collects.
4. Enable the level to be changed using F for Forward and B for Backward.
5. Make System.out statement that prints the entire map and allows us to visually see the player moving in the 2D array.
6. Make a GUI.
7. Set up all other very basic components to the game as described in the UML diagram.

Reasons for difference in estimated to actual time / complications with each step:
1. We attempted a much more complicated method of loading the levels instead of just standard text originally.
	After, the reader began to give errors in the actual loading to the map, and we were required to de-bug to find out
	what went wrong. We are too embarassed to share why we failed.
2. The entities with their own special properties took up a majority of the extra 15 minutes of coding.
	Associating the key presses to movement of the player was relatively simple after just setting up everything else.
3. Creating a tracker for emeralds is much easier than expected.
4. Once the key listener was already established for the player movement, all we had to do was make the code for loading
	the next level.
5. About what we were expecting.
6. We tried making it with a JPanel, and nothing worked. Long story short we got tired and wanted to stop working
	for the night, and because this is an optional part for the project, we stopped.
7. Setting up the framework for the game and ensuring all the classes worked with each other took slightly longer than
	anticipated, but no complications arose.
